Welcome to my personal website!

I write mathematics in my free time, as well as some things on Christianity.

I thank God for all the knowledge He has granted to me, and I want to in turn share my
knowledge with others.

(In case there's a need to reach me, use this [email](mailto:coderatwork64@gmail.com).)
